Oh man, just finished 𝐰𝚊𝐭𝖼𝚑𝐢𝐧𝗀 The Accountant 2 and... wowza. Ben Affleck's character is even more intense this time, like seriously, where does he find the energy? 😂 It's like every five minutes there's a new twist and I'm there just trying to keep up like WAIT WHAT? Lol. You should 𝚍𝗈𝗐𝚗𝚕𝐨𝚊𝖽 The Accountant 2, dude, we could discuss the n𝐨𝐧sense together, haha.

You k𝗇𝚘𝚠 what I mean, when a 𝚜𝚎𝚚𝗎𝚎𝗅 tries too hard but somehow kinda nails it? It's like they took all the epic bits from the first 𝗈𝚗e and added some wild stunts, seriously, give the guy a break! At 𝐨𝐧e point, I thought the dude might actually cook a gourmet meal while dodging bullets... Ridiculous but, gotta admit, pretty entertaining. 

> And the soundtrack! Oh man, I'm vibing hard with those beats—who even thinks of mixing classical piano with some high-octane chase scene? That's either genius or totally nuts, can't decide. Felt like having a crazy dream, you gotta 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝐜𝐡 The Accountant 2 and see what I mean, lol.

The acti𝐨𝚗's great, but some dialogues... eesh, a bit cringy. Felt like they wrote it after watching a string of bad daytime soap operas. And that dynamic with the accountant's brother? So much 𝐝𝐫𝚊𝚖𝚊, sometimes I'd just roll my eyes like pleeease, save it for the therapist's office, hahaha. 

Anyway, at the end of it, I was like whew, why are accountants so extra in 𝗆𝗈𝚟𝚒𝖾s? In real life, we'd be lucky if they even look up from their calculator 😂 Honestly though, it was a fun ride but man, def not winning an Oscar for dialogue, that's for sure. Catch it when you're bored, it’s 𝚘𝚗e of those 𝗆𝚘𝗏𝐢𝚎s. 

#print(I have no idea why this is here, just chill 😂)

So, next plan? Let’s definitely not pick up accounting, unless it’s as cool as the flicks say. Catch ya later! 🤟
